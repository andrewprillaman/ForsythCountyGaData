"housing is almost always a net negative to the tax digest.
I believe a single family home has to be valued at well over 800k to even break even. If they have multiple kids, even higher.
Apartments and townhouses are a HUGE net negative to the tax digest. It's the primary reason our property taxes have exploded. More kids = higher taxes.
The school systems eats up 80%+ of our residential property taxes collected."

"Did you know we currently have a shortage of single family homes in FoCo? This also makes the costs of homes here higherâ€¦ we were under siege for years by the multi family developers. Because the investment financial communityâ€¦ pushed their financing incentives all over for multi family projects and away from single family developmentsâ€¦. Faster return on their investment w those multi unitsâ€¦ again fast money, high profit margins ðŸ˜Ž"
