"housing is almost always a net negative to the tax digest.
I believe a single family home has to be valued at well over 800k to even break even. If they have multiple kids, even higher.
Apartments and townhouses are a HUGE net negative to the tax digest. It's the primary reason our property taxes have exploded. More kids = higher taxes.
The school systems eats up 80%+ of our residential property taxes collected."
